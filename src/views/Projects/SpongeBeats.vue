      Fortnite dancing, iconic Spongebob lines, naruto running, and more. It's hard to explain
      in words, so I'd recommend just trying it out yourself.

      This was done as a term project for a '3D Modeling in Blender' class I took. I spent the semester creating,
      rigging, and animating the initial Spongebob model you see when you start the game (yes, the crappy looking one ðŸ˜‚).
      As part of the final project, I had to integrate the 3D model into a game that I create in Unity. The final product
      is SpongeBeats.
