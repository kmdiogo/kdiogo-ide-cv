      An avid coder with a passion for solving problems and automation

      <p>
        I am a <span class="font-bold">full-stack developer</span> with industry
        experience working with
        <span class="font-bold">web development</span> technologies. The types of
        work I do include web <span class="font-bold">front-ends</span>, web
        server <span class="font-bold">back-ends</span>,
        <span class="font-bold">CI/CD</span> pipeline automation, and deployment of
        <span class="font-bold">containerized micro-services</span> into <span class="font-bold">Kubernetes</span> environments
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated from Youngstown State University (YSU) with a degree in
        <span class="font-bold">Computer Science</span> and a minor in
        Mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ever since beginning my studies at YSU, I have developed a
        passion for Computer Science and programming. Though I primarily specialize
        in Web Development, I'm always interested in learning more about a wide variety of
        other technologies. I frequently find myself applying concepts from these other technologies
        into my everyday work. Whether it's design patterns from OS-level architecture making its way
        into my applications or Graph Theory knowledge informing how I design data models, a healthy breadth of technical
        knowledge (even if at a surface-level) always seems to find a way to help in some way.
